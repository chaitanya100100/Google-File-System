- make a new file

check with paper
- append request from client to server will be of form (filename)
  - server will return the chunk handle of end of file
  - then client will request chunk server with form (chunk handle, string)
  - chunk server will add extra chunks if needed, then he will notify server, and then it will return to client

- read request will be of form (filename, start_offset, number_of_chars_to_read)
  - filename = name of file
  - start_offset = start char from where we want to read, default is 0
  - number_of_chars_to_read = number of chars to read, default is -1 suggesting that entire file is to be read


this one is complicated, see the paper
- write request from client to master will be of form (filename, start_offset, string_length)
  - master will decide the chunk to modify (the one containing the start offset),
  the chunks to delete (the ones after the offset),
  and the chunks to add (made from string)
- then write request from
